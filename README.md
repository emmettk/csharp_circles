## C# Circles ##

Make pretty rainbow backgrounds using C# and pixel math!
The file desktopmaker.cs contains the code to make the backgrounds. It is commented and hopefully usable.
Makefile_desktopmaker is a makefile for compiling on Mac with mcs and mono.

The folder DesktopBackgrounds contains some sample output from desktopmaker.

There is also a little piece of code to make Clifford Attractors.
The file clifford.cs will draw the attractor. The file clifford.png is an example output from clifford.cs. 
Makefile_clifford is a makefile for clifford.cs on Mac (uses mcs and mono.) 
I have not looked at the Clifford Attractor code in awhile and make no guarantees as to its condition.
