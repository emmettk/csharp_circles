## C# Circles ##

Make pretty rainbow backgrounds using C# and pixel math!
The file desktopmaker.cs contains the code to make the backgrounds. It is commented and hopefully usable.
The file circlemaker.cs is obsolete.
Makefile_desktopmaker is a makefile for compiling on Mac with mcs / mono.

There is also a little piece of code to make Clifford Attractors
clifford.cs will draw the attractor
Makefile_clifford is a makefile for clifford.cs on Mac (uses mcs and mono.) 
I have not looked at the Clifford Attractor code in awhile.
